I created the contents of this repo as homework for my Bootcamp at UofO
### Homework 06: Weather Dashboard
* jQuery
* Local storage
* Multiple (probably incorrectly) api calls
* and... Moment, Font Awesome, and Bootstrap
### Additional notes/lessons learned
This could have been done several different ways.  Started by understanding how to create the main card using the `weather?q=`, but *could* have used `forecast?q=` for a single request.  I also took the forecast response and broke it down to display 5 days with `list[i * 8]`.  If I were to rework this, I would figure out how to look for 1500 in each of the 40 objects in `list`.
### Could look better
